# Compatibility

## Obsidian

The `ONS` Obsidian plugin requires a minimum version of `v1.6.7` to install and run.

## Central Control Service and NAS End

The `ONS` NAS service and central control service are only supported on `Linux`.

To run the central control service, a minimum of 1 `500MHz` CPU core and at least `50MB` of RAM is required.

## Browsers

The ONS central control server and NAS end web interface do not support Internet Explorer!!!

Confirmed supported browsers include `Edge`, `Firefox`, `Chrome`, and `Safari`.

Technically, it should work on most modern browsers that are not too old (e.g., versions within the last 2 years), but due to limited development resources, testing has only been done on `Edge`.
